### Verifying Container Signatures for Tamperment Detection

To verify the container image hasn't been modified post-publishing, follow these steps:

1. [Install cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/) (make sure to update the steps to use the latest version)
2. Get the SHA of the container image (i.e. by clicking into one of the lines in https://github.com/Grunet/cloud-native-honeypot/pkgs/container/cloud-native-honeypot)
3. Run the following command

```bash
cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com --certificate-identity=https://github.com/Grunet/cloud-native-honeypot/.github/workflows/release-honeypot.yaml@refs/heads/main ghcr.io/grunet/cloud-native-honeypot@sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Where the long string of a's is replaced by the actual SHA.

You should then see output like 

```
Verification for ghcr.io/grunet/cloud-native-honeypot@sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
```

which confirms the repository and image haven't been tampered with.

### Notes on Github Workflows

Python installs should be cached in CI according to https://github.com/actions/setup-python/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#hosted-tool-cache

Pypi poetry dependencies should be cached by the `setup-python` action in CI.

Docker layers should be getting cached in Github Actions per the settings on the docker/build-push-action action (specifically the `mode=max`) that should be aggressively caching intermediate layers of the multi-stage build (and not just the final layer). This should mean that dependencies should be getting pulled from cache, so long as the requirements.txt file doesnâ€™t change (or anything prior in the Dockerfile to the installing of dependencies with pip that would trigger subsequent layer caches to be invalidated) rather than redownloaded from the internet.

## Tools in Place

### Security Static Analysis

Github's CodeQL enabled at the repository level with the default configuration is the only thing currently in use for the Python code in this subproject.
