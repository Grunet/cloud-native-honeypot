TODO - add a callout for this - Codespaces devcontainer version of Python installed via apt-get is pinned down to a minor version, not a patch version (Could pin to a patch version if compiling Python from scratch but this would be very very slow)

TODO - Philosophy is that should try to avoid production PyPi dependencies as much as possible, but taking on more dev dependencies as is convenient is acceptable risk
